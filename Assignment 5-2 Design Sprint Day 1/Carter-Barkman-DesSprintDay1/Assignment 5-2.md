Design Sprint Day 1
Scenarios:
1. Davey Dave, age 20, is a student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Born and raised in Charlotte, Davey loves to mess around with technology. Davey is attending UNCC with his eyes set on a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. Though he is currently a sophomore, Davey dislikes the overall registration process for his courses and wishes there was an easier way to get the information he needs.
2. John Doe, age 43, is a professor at the same university as Davey. Growing up in Philadelphia John always had a passion for helping and teaching others. He channeled this passion at the University of Pennsylvania to get a bachelor’s degree and later a master’s degree in Mathematics to become a teacher. Now that John has been teaching for over 10 years he has seen the stress and frustration registration season brings for students and is looking for a way to help his students.
3. Jane Doe, age 41, is a high school teacher at Lake Norman Charter who loves her job. Born and raised in Charlotte, Jane moved to Pennsylvania to pursue her dream of becoming a teacher. Since she had always loved writing, Jane obtained a bachelor’s degree in English to share her love of writing with kids. Naturally, as the wife of John Doe and fellow teacher, Jane has heard all about the struggles incoming and current students face during course registration time and has been looking for solutions to better prepare her students for college life.
4. Billy Bob, age 19, is also a student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Growing up in Kansas City, Billy has always dreamed of going to college. While Billy does not know what his major will be so far he has been enjoying his college life but dislikes the registration process. As of now, Billy is looking for a way to have everything he needs for registration in one place for easy access.
