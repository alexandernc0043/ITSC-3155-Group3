      Consisting of only 5 students, ReviewMaster was created out of a need for a
      simpler way to view crucial information for the everyday graduate student. As
      college students ourselves, we constantly found ourselves drowning in scattered
      resources, conflicting reviews, and overwhelming choices. So, we decided to
      build a tool that cuts through the noise. ReviewMaster is designed to
      centralize the insights that matter most—whether it’s feedback on courses,
      professors, or avaliable course tutors. Our goal
      is to empower students to make informed decisions quickly, without the stress.
      We may be a small team, but we’re passionate, driven, and deeply connected to
      the struggles of student life. ReviewMaster isn’t just a project—it’s a
      solution we wish we had from day one, and now we’re sharing it with you.
