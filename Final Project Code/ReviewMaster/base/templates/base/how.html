    <h1>How We Did It?</h1>
    <p>
      To bring ReviewMaster to life, we combined our skills and collaborated closely
      to build a web platform from the ground up. Using Django as our backend
      framework allowed us to efficiently manage data, handle user authentication,
      and build a secure, scalable application. Python was the core language behind
      our logic and data processing, making it easier to create clean, maintainable
      code that powers the heart of the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the front end, we used a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a
      responsive and intuitive user interface. We focused on delivering a clean,
      user-friendly experience that makes navigating information quick and
      hassle-free. From styling the layout to handling interactive features, each
      piece was crafted with the student experience in mind. As a small team of
      five, we wore many hatsâ€”but that only made the process more rewarding and the
      final product something we're incredibly proud of.
